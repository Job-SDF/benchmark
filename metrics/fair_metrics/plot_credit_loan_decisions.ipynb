        "Fairness considerations of credit loan decisions\n================================================\n\nFairness and credit lending in the US\n-------------------------------------\n\nIn 2019, Apple received backlash on social media after its newly\nlaunched *Apple Card* product appeared to offer higher credit limits to\nmen compared to women `nedlund2019apple`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"footcite\"}. In multiple cases, married couples found the husband\nreceived a credit limit that was 10-20x higher than the wife\\'s even\nwhen the couple had joint assets.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, financial institutions that operate\nwithin the United States are subject to *legal regulations* prohibiting\ndiscrimination on the [basis of race, gender, or other protected classes\n:footcite:\\`uscode2011title15chapter41subchapteriv]{.title-ref}. With\nthe increasing prevalence of automated decision-systems in the financial\nlending space, experts have raised concerns about whether these systems\ncould exacerabate existing inequalities in financial lending.\n\nAlthough the two concepts are intertwined, algorithmic fairness is not\nthe same concept as anti-discrimination law. An AI system can comply\nwith anti-discrimination law while exhibiting fairness-related concerns.\nOn the other hand, some fairness interventions may be illegal under\nanti-discrimination law.\n:footcite`Xiang2019legalcompatibility`{.interpreted-text role=\"cts\"}\ndiscuss the compatibilities and disconnects between anti-discrimination\nlaw and algorithmic notions of fairness. In this case study, we focus on\nfairness in financial services rather than compliance with financial\nanti-discrimination regulations.\n\nErnst & Young (EY) case study\n=============================\n\nIn this case study, we aim to replicate the work done in a white paper\n`dudik2020assessing`{.interpreted-text role=\"footcite\"}, co-authored by\n*Microsoft* and *EY*, on mitigating gender-related performance\ndisparities in financial lending decisions. In their analysis, Microsoft\nand EY demonstrated how Fairlearn could be used to measure and mitigate\nunfairness in the loan adjudication process.\n\nUsing a dataset of credit loan outcomes (whether an individual defaulted\non a credit loan), we train a fairness-unaware model to predict the\nlikelihood an individual will default on a given loan. We use the\nFairlearn toolkit for assessing the fairness of our model, according to\nseveral metrics. Finally, we perform two unfairness mitigation\nstrategies on our model and compare the results to our original model.\n\nBecause the dataset used in the white paper is not publicly available,\nwe will introduce a semi-synthetic feature into an existing publicly\navailable dataset to replicate the outcome disparity found in the\noriginal dataset.\n\nCredit decisions dataset\n------------------------\n\nAs mentioned, we will not be able to use the original loans dataset, and\ninstead will be working with a publicly available dataset of credit card\ndefaults in Taiwan collected in 2005. This dataset represents binary\ncredit card default outcomes for 30,000 applicants with information\npertaining to an applicant\\'s payment history and bill statements over a\nsix-month period from April 2005 to September 2005, as well as\ndemographic information, such as *sex*, *age*, *marital status*, and\n*education level* of the applicant. A full summary of features is\nprovided below:\n\n  features                                                                   description\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------\n  sex, education, marriage, age                                              demographic features\n  pay\\_0, pay\\_2, pay\\_3, pay\\_4, pay\\_5, pay\\_6                             repayment status (ordinal)\n  bill\\_amt1, bill\\_amt2, bill\\_amt3, bill\\_amt4, bill\\_amt5, bill\\_amt\\_6   bill statement amount (Taiwan dollars)\n  pay\\_amt1, pay\\_amt2, pay\\_amt3, pay\\_amt4, pay\\_amt5, pay\\_amt6           previous statement amount (Taiwan dollars)\n  default payment next month                                                 default information (1 = YES, 0 = NO)\n\nLet\\'s pretend we are a data scientist at a financial institution who is\ntasked with developing a classification model to predict whether an\napplicant will default on a personal loan. A positive prediction by the\nmodel means the applicant would default on the credit loan. *Defaulting\non a loan* means the client fails to make payments within a 30-day\nwindow, and the lender can take legal actions against the client.\n\nAlthough we do not have a dataset of loan default history, we do have\nthis data set of credit card payment history. We assume customers who\nmake monthly credit card payments on time are more *creditworthy*, and\nthus less likely to default on a personal credit loan.\n\n**Decision point: task definition**\n\n-   **Defaulting on a credit card payment** can be viewed as a proxy for\n    the fact that an applicant might not be a good candidate for a\n    personal loan.\n-   Because most customers did not default on their credit card payment,\n    we will need to take this class imbalance into account during our\n    modeling process.\n\nAs the data is read in-memory, we will change the column `PAY_0` to\n`PAY_1` to make the naming more consistent with the naming of the other\ncolumns. In addition, the target variable `default payment next month`\nis changed to `default` to reduce verbosity.\n"

        "Types of harm experienced\n=========================\n\nWhen discussing fairness in AI systems, the first step is understanding\nwhat types of harms we anticipate the system may produce. Using the\n`harms taxonomy in the Fairlearn User Guide <types_of_harms>`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"ref\"}, we expect this system to produce *harms of allocation*. In\naddition, we also anticipate the long-term impact on an individual\\'s\ncredit score if an individual is unable to repay a loan they receive or\nif they are rejected for a loan application. A *harm of allocation*\noccurs when an AI system extends or withholds resources, opportunities,\ninformation. In this scenario, the AI system is extending or withholding\nfinancial assets from individuals. A review of historical incidents\nshows these types of automated lending decision systems may discriminate\nunfairly based on sex.\n\n**Negative impact of credit score**\n\nA secondary harm that is somewhat unique to credit lending decisions is\nthe long-term impact on an individual\\'s credit score. In the United\nStates, a [FICO credit\nscore](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) is a\nnumber between 300 and 850 that represents a customer\\'s\n*creditworthiness*. An applicant\\'s *credit score* is used by many\nfinancial institutions for lending decisions. An applicant\\'s *credit\nscore* usually increases after a successful repayment of a loan and\ndecreases if the applicant fails to repay the loan.\n\nWhen applying for a credit loan, there are three major outcomes:\n\n1.  The individual receives the credit loan and pays back the loan. In\n    this scenario, we expect the individual\\'s credit score to increase\n    as a result of the successful repayment of the loan.\n2.  The individual receives the credit loan but defaults on the loan. In\n    this scenario, the individual\\'s credit score will drop drastically\n    due to the failure to repay the loan. In the modeling process, this\n    outcome is tied to a **false negative** (the model predicts the\n    individual will repay the loan, but the individual is unsuccessful\n    in doing so).\n3.  In certain countries, such as the United States, an individual\n    receives a small drop (up to five points) to their credit score\n    after a lender performs a *hard inquiry* on the applicant\\'s credit\n    history. If the applicant applies for a loan but does not receive\n    it, the small decrease in their credit score will impact their\n    ability to successfully apply for a future loan. In the modeling\n    process, this outcome is tied to the **selection rate** (the\n    proportion of positive predictions outputted by the model).\n\n**Prevention of wealth accumulation**\n\nOne other type of harm we anticipate in this scenario is the long-term\neffects of *denying loans to applicants who would have successfully paid\nback the loan*. By receiving a loan, an applicant is able to purchase a\nhome, start a business, or pursue some other economic activity that they\nare not able to do otherwise. These outcomes are tied to **false\npositive error** rates in which the model predicts an applicant will\ndefault on the loan, but the individual would have successfully paid the\nloan back. In the United States, the practice of redlining\n`peyton2020redlining`{.interpreted-text role=\"footcite\"}, denying\nmortgage loans and other financial services to predominantly Black or\nother minority communities, has resulted in a vast racial wealth gap\nbetween white and Black Americans. Although the practice of redlining\nwas banned in 1968 with the *Fair Housing Act*, the long-term impact of\nthese practices `jan2018redlining`{.interpreted-text role=\"footcite\"} is\nreflected in the lack of economic investment in Black communities, and\nBlack applicants are denied loans at a higher rate compared to white\nAmericans.\n\nDefine fairness metrics based on harms\n--------------------------------------\n\nNow that we have identified the relevant harms we anticipate users will\nexperience, we can define our fairness metrics. In addition to the\nmetrics, we will quantify the uncertainty around each metric using\n*custom functions* to compute the *standard error* for each metric at\nthe $\\alpha=0.95$ confidence level.\n"

In practice, we\nwould develop some weighting mechanism to assign a weight to each *false\nnegative* and *false positive* event.\n\nMitigating Unfairness in ML models\n==================================\n\nIn the previous section, we identified disparities in the model\\'s\nperformance with respect to `SEX`. In particular, we found that model\nproduces a significantly higher `false_negative_rate` and\n`false_positive_rate` for the applicants labeled `female` compared to\nthose labeled `male`. In the context of credit decision scenario, this\nmeans the model under-allocates loans to *women* who would have paid the\nloan, but over-allocates loans to *women* who go on to default on their\nloan.\n\nIn this section, we will discuss strategies for mitigating the\nperformance disparities we found in our unmitigated model. We will apply\ntwo different mitigation strategies:\n\n-   *Postprocessing*: In the postprocessing approach, the outputs of a\n    trained classifier are transformed to satisfy some fairness\n    criterion.\n-   *Reductions*: In the reductions approach, we take in a model class\n    and iteratively create a sequence of models that optimize some\n    fairness constraint. Compared to the *postprocessing* approach, the\n    fairness constraint is satisfied during the model training time\n    rather than afterwards.\n\nPostprocessing mitigations: ThresholdOptimizer\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIn the Fairlearn package, *postprocessing* mitigation is offered through\nthe `ThresholdOptimizer` algorithm, following\n:footcite`hardt2016equality`{.interpreted-text role=\"cts\"}. The\n`ThresholdOptimizer` takes in an existing (possibly pre-fit) machine\nlearning model whose predictions acts as a scoring function to identify\nseparate thresholds for each *sensitive feature* group. The\n`ThresholdOptimizer` optimizes a specified objective metric (in our\ncase, `balanced_accuracy`) subject to some fairness constraint\n([equalized\\_odds]{.title-ref}), resulting in a thresholded version of\nthe underlying machine learning model.\n\nTo instantiate our `ThresholdOptimizer`, we need to specify our fairness\nconstraint as a model parameter. Because both `false_negative_rate`\ndisparities and `false_positive_rate` disparities translate into\nreal-world harms in our scenario, we will aim to minimize the\n`equalized_odds` difference as our *fairness constraint*.\n"

One key limitation of the\n`ThresholdOptimizer` is needing access to our *sensitive\\_feature*\nduring prediction time.\n\nIn this section, we will use the *reductions* approach of Agarwal et. al\n(2018) `agarwal2018reductions`{.interpreted-text role=\"footcite\"} to\nproduce models that satisfy the fairness constraint without needing\naccess to the sensitive features at deployment time.\n\nThe main reduction algorithm in Fairlearn is `ExponentiatedGradient`.\nThe algorithm creates a sequence of re-weighted datasets and retrains\nthe wrapped classifier on each of the datasets. This re-training process\nis guaranteed to find a model that satisfies the fairness constraints\nwhile optimizing the performance metric.\n\nThe model returned by `ExponentiatedGradient` consists of several inner\nmodels, returned by a wrapped estimator.\n\nTo instantiate an `ExponentiatedGradient` model, we pass in two\nparameters:\n\n-   a base `estimator` (object that supports training)\n-   fairness `constraints` (object of type\n    `fairlearn.reductions.Moment`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"})\n\nWhen passing in a fairness *constraint* as a `Moment`, we can specify an\n`epsilon` value representing the maximum allowed difference or ratio\nbetween our largest and smallest value. For example, in the below code,\n`EqualizedOdds(difference_bound=epsilon)` means that we are using\n`EqualizedOdds` as our fairness constraint, and we will allow a maximal\ndifference of `epsilon` between our largest and smallest *equalized\nodds* value.\n"

        "We see both of our fairness-aware models yield a slight decrease in the\n*balanced\\_accuracy* for *male applicants* compared to our\nfairness-unaware model. In the *reductions* model, we see a decrease in\nthe *false positive rate* for *female applicants*. This is accompanied\nby an increase in the *false negative rate* for *male applicants*.\nHowever overall, the *equalized odds difference* for the *reductions*\nmodels is lower than that of the original fairness-unaware model.\n\nConclusion and Discussion\n=========================\n\nIn this case study, we walked through the process of assessing a credit\ndecision model for gender-related performance disparities. Our analysis\nfollows closely the work done in the Microsoft/EY white paper\n`dudik2020assessing`{.interpreted-text role=\"footcite\"} where they used\nthe *Fairlearn* toolkit to perform an audit of a fairness-unaware\ntree-based model. We applied a *postprocessing* and *reductions*\nmitigation techniques to mitigate the *equalized odds difference* in our\nmodel.\n\nThrough the *reductions* process, we generated a model that reduces the\n*equalized odds difference* of the original model without a drastic\nincrease in the *balanced error score*. If this were a real model being\ndeveloped a financial institution, the *balanced error score* would be a\nproxy for the profitability of the model. By maintaining a relatively\nsimilar *balanced error score*, we\\'ve produced a model that preserves\nprofitability to the firm while producing more fair and equitable\noutcomes for women in this scenario.\n\nDesigning a Model Card\n----------------------\n\nA key facet of Responsible Machine Learning is responsible documentation\npractices. :footcite`mitchell2019model`{.interpreted-text role=\"ct\"}\nproposed the model card framework for documentating and reporting model\ntraining details and deployment considerations.\n\nA *model card* contains sections for documenting training and evaluation\ndataset descriptions, ethical concerns, and quantitative evaluation\nsummaries. In practice, we would ideally create a model card for our\nmodel before deploying it in production. Although we will not be\nproducing a model card in this case study, interested readers can learn\nmore about creating model cards using the *Model Card Toolkit* from the\n[Fairlearn PyCon\ntutorial](https://github.com/fairlearn/talks/tree/main/2022_pycon).\n\nFairness under unawareness\n--------------------------\n\nWhen proving credit models are compliant with fair lending laws,\npractitoners may run into the issue of not having access to the\nsensitive demographic features. As a result, financial institutions are\noften tasked with proving their models are compliant with fair lending\nlaws by imputing these demographics features. However,\n:footcite`chen2019fairness`{.interpreted-text role=\"ct\"} show these\nimputation methods often introduce new fairness-related issues.\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n::: {.footbibliography}\n:::\n"
